Learning how to use GitHub
Hi, I'm a computer science student at Massey University, studying by distance learning. I have just started my 100-level computer science papers. I already have a Bachelor of Arts with a Major in Politics and Minor in Philosophy, so the next step after completing my 100-levels will be to move on to a Post Graduate Diploma in Software Engineering. From there, I intend to complete a Masters in Information Science with a Major in Artificial Intelligence, which will give me the skill set to pursue a career in computational problem solving.
